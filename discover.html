            <h2>Inheritance of the Culture</h2>

            <p>The Ryukyu Kingdom developed its distinctive culture and it was influenced by many countries in Asia. The unique culture has been inherited from generation to generation. It brings strong bonds to our ancestors who had given the greatest gifts to us. The custom of respecting one`s ancestors and caring for your ancestors and family is more rooted in Okinawa than elsewhere in Japan. </p>

            <p>One might find the core of their identities, and one might find the heart of Ryukyu through the culture.</p>

            <h2>Traditional Events and Festivals</h2>
            <p>Traditional events and festivals have been held and passed down for many years in communities. There are many other rites and festivals, such as prayers for a bountiful harvest and safe travel at sea, that are very rich in local flavor.</p>

            <p>Here, you will learn some traditional events that are most appealing and important to Okinawans.</p>

                <p>Shimi, the grave-sweeping festival, is on the 15th day of the third month of the Chinese lunar calendar, which in the Western solar calendar usually falls in April.

The whole family sweeps and cleans their ancestral tomb, and provides offerings to the dead, and afterward, they enjoy eating food in the courtyard. </p>

                <p>Hari is a maritime festival held to pray for the safety of fishermen and for bountiful catches. It is held in fishing ports across Okinawa, usually in May.

                <p>The Naha Tug-of-War is an event at the annual festival held in Naha. It originates as a ritual to pray for a bountiful harvest, sound health, and fertility. In 1995, the rope used in the festival was listed in the Guinness World Records as the largest rice-straw rope used in a tug-of-war. The festival begins with men dressed in traditional Okinawan dress standing on the rope facing the opposite direction to symbolize the battle between East and West.</p>
