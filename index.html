            <h1>My final project topic is: An Okinawan community website</h1>

            <h2><i>The Heart of Ryukyu</i></h2>
            
            <p>Welcome to RNK. RNK stands for "Ryukyu no kokoro," meaning the heart of Ryukyu. "Ryukyu" is what Okinawa used to be called a long time ago.</p>
            <p>This website is for people who are interested in learning about Okinawa, and for Okinawan immigrants who have roots in Okinawa and want to get an opportunity to learn about their roots.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Making a place where people can feel connections to their roots and learn about Okinawan culture.</p>
            <p>Making this website to be a place that introduces the uniqueness of Okinawa to people who are interested in Okinawa.</p>
            <p>Making this website that interests people who do not know about Okinawa and make them want to know more about Okinawa.</p>

            <h3>Greeting from the owner</h3>
            <p>My name is Yuria Loo. I was born and raised in Okinawa, Japan. I moved to Seattle, WA with my American husband in 2020.</p>
            <p>The reason I wanted to make this website is I saw many Japanese immigrant communities in here in the U.S., but there were few communities for people who are from Okinawa, especially around the Seattle area. So, I thought making a community website could contribute to helping people get an opportunity to learn about Okinawa, as well as be proud of their roots.</p>
