                <h3>Sesoko Island</h3>
                <p>Sesoko Island is a remote island that can be reached from the main island of Okinawa by crossing the 762-meter (2500 ft) long Sesoko Ohashi Bridge. The natural beach stretches for about 800 meters along the island's west coast. The contrast between the clear emerald-green sea and white sand is stunning. The beach is also a perfect spot for the sunset. </p>

                <p>The castle site is located in Uruma, Okinawa. In 2000, Katsuren-jo Castle was designated as a World Heritage Site. It was built on a large hill of Ryukyuan limestone, 98 meters (322 ft) above sea level on the Katsuren Peninsula. Its golden age was in the mid-15th century, under the powerful Aji (a ruler or lord) of Katsuren, Amawari. The various structural remnants inside the castle walls offer hints to how prosperous the Aji was at the time.</p>
